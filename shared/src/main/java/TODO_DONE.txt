- Changed true Vanguard funds to start with 'Vanguard'
  (we could do this more accurately at extraction with VGD_GetFundName)

- Yearly process for fund db
   + Vanguard & FundAccess funds

- Edit URL/name etc, with large # entries (e.g. PPM) gave error in Jetty (form & too many ids)
  To fix, added this to appengine-web.xml: <property name="org.eclipse.jetty.server.Request.maxFormKeys" value="40000"/> <!-- OBS: Important to support changing URL/name with big lists, e.g. PPM -->
- ExtractDebugger is done
- Make the (R) registered sign go away
  Caused by &reg being present in HTML output, need to perform .replace("&", ""&amp;")
- Difficulty displaying Å, Ä, Ö, å, ä, ö
  Caused by not being proper utf-8. Always use JSP file (with UTF-8), never use hardcoded servlet (which seems to want to use iso-8859...)
- Errored funds should become invalid second time around


***********
- Remove invalids
Invalids. Count: 3.
